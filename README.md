# Data Preparation:
- Organizing AudioMNIST dataset
- Implementing audio processing pipeline (resampling to 16Hz, noise reduction, etc.)
- Outcome: scripts for preprocessing dataset; train-test split

# Feature Engineering:
- feature extraction (e.g. mel-spectogram conversion, normalization)
- data augmentation (time-stretching, pitch shifting, background noise injection)
- outcome: script for feature extraction and data augmentation  

# Model Design:
- designing different architectures
- designing training code
- outcome: architectures + hyperparameter grids

# Model Training & Evaluation:
- run model training
- calculate classification metrics
- outcome: hyperparameter-tuning+training+testing

# Deployment:
